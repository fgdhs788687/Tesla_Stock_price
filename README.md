# Tesla Stock Price Predictor API
A Flask-based web application and machine learning pipeline for predicting Tesla stock prices. This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

# üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture
This project is structured as a two-part system: a machine learning pipeline and a RESTful API.
1. Data & Modeling Pipeline: The tesla_eda_fe.ipynb and model_training.ipynb notebooks detail the process of cleaning raw stock data, engineering new features, and training a LassoCV regression model.
   The trained model and data scaler are persisted using Python's pickle library.
2. API & Web Server: The application.py Flask server exposes an endpoint (/predictprice) that accepts stock data, preprocesses it using the saved scaler, and returns a prediction from the saved model.
